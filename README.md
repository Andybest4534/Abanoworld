This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# MY DOCUMENTATION BEGINS HERE
# Abano World 🌍

Abano World is a Next.js + Tailwind CSS project designed to host a Blog, Vlog, Portfolio, and E-Commerce platform.

## Progress Log

### ✅ Initial Setup
- Installed Node.js, Git, and Visual Studio Code.
- Linked Copilot to VS Code for assistance.
- Created a new Next.js project using `create-next-app` named **abanoworld**.
- Installed dependencies: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, ESLint.
- Verified the app runs locally at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Opened the project folder in VS Code and explored the file structure.
- Confirmed the default homepage (`app/page.tsx`) is working and ready for customization.

### ✅ Hydration Warning Resolution
- Observed hydration mismatch warnings during development.
- Identified the cause: crypto wallet browser extension injecting attributes into the DOM.
- Created a new Chrome user profile without extensions.
- Confirmed warnings no longer interfere with development.

### 🎯 Refined Project Target
- Decided to focus first on beautifying the homepage for Abano World.
- Next priority: build the online store, starting with AndyGadgetsCare.
- AndyGadgetsCare currently runs on WhatsApp Business; plan to integrate it into the website.
- Other modules (Blog, Vlog, Portfolio) will follow after homepage and store are complete.

### ✅ Store Page Setup
- Created new folder `app/store/`.
- Added `page.tsx` inside `app/store/` to define the store route.
- Store page now accessible at `/store`.

### ✅ Git Workflow Setup
- Learned that the terminal running `npm run dev` is locked to the server process.
- Opened a second terminal in VS Code for Git commands.
- Can now run Git operations (init, commit, push) without stopping the dev server.
